<div class="a">
<p>It was an academic project. We studied basics of sound, features of voices, GANs and its varient. We mainly focused on GAN models and implemented CycleGAN and StarGAN with different libraries such as tensorflow and pytorch. We observed, implenetation of StarGAN + pytorch was giving the best output. We tried to modified StarGAN and made the training faster. It isn't generating clean output which can overcome by some changes. We will modify it furhter to generate fast and better results.</p>
